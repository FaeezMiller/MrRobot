            <h6>Who is elliot?</h6>
            <p>Young, anti-social computer programmer Elliot works as a cybersecurity engineer during the day, but at night he is a vigilante hacker. He is recruited by the mysterious leader of an underground group of hackers to join their organization. Elliot's
              task? Help bring down corporate America, including the company he is paid to protect, which presents him with a moral dilemma. Although he works for a corporation, his personal beliefs make it hard to resist the urge to take down the heads
              of multinational companies that he believes are running -- and ruining -- the world.</p>

          </div>
  <br>
          <p>Elliot suffers from social anxiety disorder, clinical depression, delusions and paranoia. His internal life is revealed via voice-overs that provide insight into his mental state, his opinions of the people he encounters and the activity around
            him. These dialogues with the audience are designed to help us interpret Elliot's world, but given his mental illness, he is an unreliable narrator, leaving us unsure whether what he tells us we're seeing is actually what is happening. Typical
            of this is when Elliot hears everyone around him refer to E Corp as Evil Corp, reflecting his own opinion of the conglomerate.</p>

              <br>
              <p>fsociety is the name of a hacker group based in Coney Island, New York, led by the mysterious Mr. Robot. Its name is a play on both the derelict amusement park building in which it has its headquarters, and their message: "f*ck society."</p>
  
              
              <br>
              <p>The group is highly secretive, electing to meet and communicate in person, rather than through digital means which may be traceable. fsociety is responsible for the massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that took E Corp offline
                before Elliot stopped them. After the attack ended, Elliot found a file left on one of the E Corp servers by fsociety. Rather than delete the file, Elliot changed the access permissions on the file to allow only himself access to it. Later,
                he was approached by Mr. Robot on the subway, and taken to Coney Island to see the group's headquarters.</p>

              <h6>What is E-Corp?</h6>
              <p>E Corp, known to Elliot by the derogatory name Evil Corp, is one of the largest multi-national conglomerates in the world. Among their enterprises, they manufacture computers, phones, and tablets, and maintain a banking and consumer credit
                division. According to Mr. Robot, the company owns 70% of the global consumer credit industry, which is why fsociety has targeted them, and why Mr. Robot recruited Elliot to help them hack into their network. Fsociety is responsible for
                a DDoS attack that lead to the dismissal and potential criminal prosecution of Terry Colby, E Corp's former Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Tyrell Wellick believes the CTO position should now be his, but he was passed over in favor of outsider
                Scott Knowles, who he then attempts to bring down.</p>
